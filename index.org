Pull data from IB because we need bid/ask and not last trade.

In this type of spread we initiate positions in options which expire on
different dates.  For example, say we sell a 50 call expiring in a month, and
buy a 50 call expiring in 2 months.  We know this will be a debit
spread---net we will have to pay because the longer-dated call will have a
higher price.
